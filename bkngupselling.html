        <h2 class="summary-title">TL;DR:</h2>
       
        <h5>What</h5>
        <p>Redesigned the post-payment failure experience on Booking.com to upsell regular inventory rooms when third-party (TPI) bookings failed.</p>
      
        <h5>Why</h5>
        <p>TPI rooms were cheaper and increased conversions upfront, but frequent payment failures led to high drop-off rates (30–50%) and user frustration.</p>
      
        <h5>How</h5>
        <p>Introduced a fallback flow that offered users a similar room with a "Pay at Property" option. Designed and iterated multiple comparison UI patterns, tested with users, and optimized for clarity and trust.</p>

        <h5>Challenges</h5>
        <p>Users were confused by early designs, overwhelmed by information, and skeptical about whether the suggested rooms were from the same hotel.</p>
        
        <h5>Impact</h5>
        <p>Nearly 50% of users who experienced a payment failure selected the upsell offer. The solution launched with positive Net Conversion and reduced bounce rates across platforms.</p>
      </div>

    <section id="context" class="section">
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>While leading design initiatives, I identified a critical drop-off point: users booking rooms from TPI were abandoning the site after failed payments. These rooms often carried multiple restrictions—non-refundable, advance payment only, limited support—and payments frequently failed.</p>   
        <p>This moment of frustration became an opportunity: what if we upsold regular inventory rooms with more flexible conditions, like “Pay at the property,” right after a failed TPI payment?</p>
    </section>

    <div class="divider"></div>


    <section id="problem" class="section">
        <h3>Context</h3>
       <p>Booking.com offered third-party inventory (TPI) rooms from providers like Agoda and other OTAs because they were significantly cheaper.
        These rooms increased conversion by showing lower prices on the site, which attracted users — even though they came with serious trade-offs.</p> 
        <p><strong>Cheaper Prices, Higher Conversion</strong></p>
        <p>Displaying lower-priced TPI rooms boosted user interest and improved overall conversion rates. The pricing advantage made users more likely to continue through the booking funnel.</p>
        <p><strong>Clear Trade-Offs Communicated</strong></p>
        <p>Booking.com was transparent about the limitations of these cheaper rooms — trade-offs were shown clearly before purchase to maintain trust. </p>      
        <div class="project-highlights">
            <ul>
                <li><h4>Advance payment required</h4><p>Users had to pay upfront, removing flexibility and increasing perceived risk.</p></li>
                <li><h4>Non-refundable</h4><p>No refunds or cancellations allowed, which led to booking hesitation.</p></li>
                <li><h4>No invoices</h4><p>No invoice issued, making it unsuitable for business or reimbursable travel.</p></li>
                <li><h4>Limited payment options</h4><p>Restricted payment methods often led to failed transactions and user drop-off.</p></li>
                <li><h4>Lack of full customer support</h4><p>Booking.com couldn’t fully support these bookings, as they were owned and managed by third-party providers.</p></li>
            </ul>

    <section id="problem" class="section">
        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>Failed payments were a common issue with TPI rooms due to limited payment methods, technical errors, or insufficient funds. When a payment failed, the experience abruptly ended with little recourse or guidance.</p>
        <div class="image-placeholder">
            <img src="img/bkng/oldxp.png">
        </div>

        <div class="quote">Research and analytics revealed that 18–33% of users who encountered a payment failure dropped off entirely—either abandoning the platform or restarting their search from scratch. This presented a clear opportunity to reduce friction and recover potential bookings.</div>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <section id="opportunity" class="section">
        <h3>Opportunity</h3>
        <p>Rather than letting failed payments mark the end of the journey, I saw an opportunity to offer users a fallback: a similar room from Booking.com’s regular inventory with a more flexible "Pay at Property" option. This option aligned better with user expectations and trust, especially after a frustrating failed transaction.</p>

                This version prioritized only essential differences: bed type, room size, and flexible policies. Copy was shortened, and the comparison was more visually digestible. Feedback improved, but users still asked whether both rooms were from the same hotel and requested images. Copy was tightened for speed and clarity.

                Users testing the third version still raised two major concerns: they couldn’t tell if the rooms were from the same hotel, and they wanted to see images. Additionally, the original error-focused title (“Your payment didn’t work”) triggered disappointment and made users less likely to engage. We reframed the message with a more positive, action-oriented tone, added hotel names to both options, and included photos for clarity and reassurance. The final layout used a compact visual table to present differences clearly, with a link to “See full details of our suggestion” for deeper exploration—striking a balance between clarity and control.

        <p><strong>Iteration 1: Split Columns with Highlighted Differences</strong></p>
        The first version used two side-by-side columns with green highlights to show differences between the selected and suggested rooms. However, this layout required users to scan back and forth, making comparisons cognitively demanding. Despite displaying the hotel name and address, users still weren’t confident the rooms were from the same property—likely due to poor positioning. Large images were intended to add visual appeal but proved risky if the suggested room lacked attractive photos.
        <div class="image-placeholder">
            <img src="img/bkng/desktop1.png">
        </div>

        <p><strong> Iteration 2: Unified Layout with Visual Cues</strong></p>
        In the second iteration, we replaced the split view with a single unified container. The hotel name was positioned prominently at the top, immediately signaling that both rooms were from the same place. We removed the heavy green highlights and instead used checkmarks to indicate added benefits. This version improved clarity and was better understood, but lacked clear hierarchy, and aligning content introduced excessive whitespace that hurt visual balance.
        <div class="image-placeholder">
            <img src="img/bkng/desktop2.png">
        </div>

        <p><strong>Final Design: Structured Table with Inline Interactions</strong></p>
        The final version borrowed structural patterns from our app design. A left-aligned label layout with horizontal dividers made scanning and comparison much easier. Users appreciated the clear "conditions" section and the ability to preview the suggested room via image click, which opened a detail pop-up without leaving the screen. Primary actions—“Book our suggestion” and “Try another payment method”—were streamlined to reduce friction. The user could complete their booking without re-entering any information, keeping the flow fast and frustration-free.
