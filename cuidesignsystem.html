        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>We were building a suite of fintech products — everything from online loan portals to internal tools for credit union employees. The problem? We had no shared design system. Components were inconsistent, styles broke across platforms, and the experience differed wildly from one product to another. </p>
        <p>Some parts of our app used Material UI (MUI), but it became a bottleneck: it was running on an outdated version, theming was rigid and hard to customize, and engineers spent too much time hacking it to meet our needs. The engineering team was also vocal about wanting full control over the UI — they were frustrated with MUI’s opinionated architecture and its overhead. We wanted something lightweight, maintainable, and tailored to our stack. </p>
        <p>To make things more complex, our products were <span class="highlight">white-labeled</span> — each credit union needed to apply its own branding. In many cases, our app was embedded inside the credit union’s mobile banking app, so visual consistency wasn’t just a preference — it was mandatory.</p>
        <p>I led the entire design system initiative, from strategy through execution. This included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>- Auditing existing components and UI debt</li>
            <li>- Creating the foundational design tokens and component architecture</li>
            <li>- Designing and maintaining a Figma library</li>
            <li>- Coding core components in React and managing Storybook</li>
            <li>- Partnering with engineers to roll out and replace legacy MUI components</li>
            <li>- Evangelizing usage across product and engineering teams</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="problem" class="section">
        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>We were scaling fast, but our design tooling wasn’t keeping up. Here’s what we were facing:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>-  <span class="highlight">Broken MUI-based components</span> across products</li>
            <li>-  <span class="highlight">Two separate frontends:</span> One for internal branch officers, and one for public-facing loan applicants</li>
            <li>-  <span class="highlight">White-label requirements:</span> 120+ credit unions, each needing to match their brand</li>
            <li>-  <span class="highlight">Duplicate efforts:</span> Different teams re-creating the same components with minor variations</li>
            <li>-  <span class="highlight">Inconsistent UX:</span> Modals, buttons, and forms looked and behaved differently depending on the product</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Strategy & Rollout</h3>
        <p>I knew a design system wouldn’t succeed unless it addressed both <span class="highlight">designer and developer</span> needs — and unless it was built with flexibility in mind.</p>
        <p>Here's how I approached it:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Audit & Inventory:</strong> Conducted a full UI audit across all products, Identified the most used and most problematic components, Partnered with devs to evaluate feasibility of replacing MUI</li>
            <li><strong>Foundation First:</strong> Created a scalable token system covering colors, spacing, typography, and elevations. I split colors into <em>system tokens</em> (for UI states like errors, warnings, success) and <em>brand tokens</em> (customized per Credit Union). I also mapped all CU brand colors and built Figma themes to preview white-label variations in real time — ensuring accessibility (WCAG AA), consistency, and flexibility across the board.</li>
            <li><strong>Component Library:</strong> Designed 40+ core components, with multiple states, variants, accessibility, and usage guidelines. Coded some of them as well.</li>
            <li><strong>Support for Two Products:</strong> Built layout templates that flexed between dense internal tools and simpler public-facing UIs, Added a “live theming” toggle in Figma to preview different brand variants, Partnered with PMs to define context-specific patterns</li>
            <li><strong>Documentation & Onboarding:</strong> Created internal Figma documentation, wrote Notion documents, ran live walkthroughs and async Loom videos for onboarding</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Convincing Stakeholders</h3>
        
        <p>I didn’t get buy-in overnight. Our Head of Product was skeptical at first — mostly because we already had something “working” in MUI for the Online Portal, and shifting priorities felt risky. The engineering teams were underwater just trying to keep up with core features, so building a Design System from scratch initially sounded like added work.</p>
        <p>But we had a unique opportunity: the Staff Portal was about to be built from the ground up. Unlike the Online Portal, which relied heavily on outdated and brittle MUI components, the Staff Portal had no UI code yet. I proposed that we use it as the foundation for our new Design System — a way to build components properly from day one, in Storybook, and fully aligned with our new design vision. That changed everything.</p>
        <p>I focused on three strategies to earn buy-in:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Prototyping pain:</strong>  I rebuilt a few of our most painful UI components and showed how the new system made them cleaner, more maintainable, and scalable.</li>
            <li><strong>Visual comparison:</strong>I created side-by-side mockups of the broken MUI components vs. the new unified design system.</li>
            <li><strong>Metrics:</strong> Talked to devs and estimated how much time we’d save in dev cycles if we invested in the new system</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>With a working example in the Staff Portal and real dev progress in Storybook, the benefits became hard to ignore. Eventually, we got the green light — and the engineering team began deprecating MUI in the Online Portal and replacing it with our new system, component by component.</p>
        <div class="quote">"Using the Staff Portal as the base was a smart move. clean slate, no MUI mess, and we could actually build stuff the right way. now it’s kinda wild to imagine going back.” – Head of Product</div>

        <h3>White-Labeling: A Major Challenge</h3>
        <p>Because the company served dozens of credit unions, each product needed to match the branding of the partner institution. In practice, that meant:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>No hardcoded colors or fonts</li>
            <li>Components needed to <span class="highlight">adapt</span> to different brand palettes</li>
            <li>The system had to look like a seamless part of each credit union's ecosystem</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To solve this, I designed a flexible <span class="highlight">token architecture</span> and created a Figma theming system where we could toggle between brand presets. This made it easy to validate themes visually, share previews with clients, and keep consistency without duplicating files.</p>

        <h3>Staff Portal vs. Online Portal</h3>
        <p>One of the biggest challenges was designing a system that worked across <strong>two very different products</strong>:</p>
    
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Staff Portal:</strong> Used by Credit Union employees in-branch. Desktop-only. Requires information density, more powerful tooling, and task-focused workflows. Branding is flexible but still needs to reflect each Credit Union’s identity.</li>
            <li><strong>Online Portal:</strong> Used by members to apply for loans or open accounts. Mobile-first. Often embedded inside the Credit Union’s mobile app, so visual integration and responsiveness are critical. Accessible, simple, and trust-building design is essential here.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <div class="two-images">
            <div class="image-placeholder">
                <img src="img/cui/hero.png">
            </div>
            <div class="image-placeholder">
                <img src="img/cui/hero.png">
            </div>
        </div>
    
        <p>Designing for both meant I had to keep the system <span class="highlight">flexible without fragmenting</span> into two separate systems. Here’s how I tackled the challenge:</p>
    
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Created variants for responsive needs:</strong> Components like navigation, tables, and form inputs had alternate versions for mobile vs. desktop use cases.</li>
            <li><strong>Used adaptive theming:</strong> While the Staff Portal could handle broader color use, the Online Portal needed stricter adherence to the Credit Union’s branding and mobile platform guidelines. I built flexibility into the token structure to support both needs.</li>
            <li><strong>Kept user context in mind:</strong> The tone, density, and interaction feedback differed across portals — so I documented usage guidance based on audience (e.g. “Use this version for branch staff” vs. “Use this variant for mobile loan applications”).</li>
            <li><strong>Shared core components, different wrappers:</strong> Where possible, I reused base components but wrapped them in layout containers appropriate to each portal’s needs.</li>
            <li><strong>Tested in Figma with live theming:</strong> I used theming toggles to preview both Staff and Online experiences in real time, speeding up design decisions and stakeholder approvals.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <div class="image-placeholder">
            <img src="img/cui/hero.png">
        </div>
    
        <p>The end result was a <strong>unified but context-aware system</strong> — one that respected the needs of two very different audiences, while giving engineers and designers a shared set of building blocks.</p>
    </section>
    

    <section id="tradeoff" class="section">
        <h3>Trade-Offs & Decisions</h3>
        <p>Design systems are all about constraints — and the most impactful decisions often involve saying "no" to infinite flexibility. One of the biggest trade-offs was around white-labeling and color customization.</p>
      
        <p>Each Credit Union wanted their app to feel “theirs” — often asking for full control over color, typography, and layout. To make this scalable, I worked closely with our Customer Success (CS) team to understand just how far each Credit Union expected to go in their custom branding. I joined calls, reviewed tickets, and even built Notion documentation to help CS educate Credit Unions about the limitations of the system.</p>
      
        <div class="image-placeholder">
            <img src="img/cui/hero.png">
        </div>
      
        <p>The compromise: I proposed that Credit Unions could define one <strong>primary brand color</strong> — but that the rest of the interface would remain consistent. I created demos showing how allowing full color overrides would lead to poor UX, low contrast ratios, and inconsistent interaction patterns across the platform.</p>
      
        <p>We also faced the challenge of Credit Unions whose brand colors were red, yellow, or other tones that didn’t meet WCAG contrast standards. To address this, I introduced a system-wide <strong>secondary fallback color</strong> — one that automatically took over in components where accessibility or visual clarity was at risk. This allowed us to preserve the CU’s identity without compromising usability.</p>
      
        <div class="image-placeholder">
            <img src="img/cui/hero.png">
        </div>
      
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Trade-off:</strong> Limited full customization to a single primary color instead of unlimited overrides.</li>
          <li><strong>Why:</strong> Prevent visual fragmentation, maintain accessibility standards, and speed up development with predictable theming logic.</li>
          <li><strong>Result:</strong> Credit Unions got just enough visual ownership to feel represented, while we kept the system cohesive, supportable, and accessible.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What I Learned</h3>
        <p>Building this design system from scratch across two separate products taught me valuable lessons not just about design craft — but also about technical architecture, organizational alignment, and scaling UX across real-world constraints.</p>
    
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Design for variability, not just consistency:</strong>
                Creating components that could adapt to different themes, breakpoints, and user contexts (staff vs. member) required me to think beyond a “single source of truth.” I leaned heavily on Figma variants, tokens, and component composition to create a system that was both modular and flexible.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Real-world development forces trade-offs:</strong>
                Working directly in the codebase, I gained hands-on experience building and documenting components in React and Storybook. This helped me internalize the engineering perspective — performance costs, prop-driven flexibility, and API naming conventions were key to adoption.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Mobile-first ≠ one-size-fits-all:</strong>
                Designing for the Online Portal (used mostly on mobile) while also supporting the more complex desktop-only Staff Portal forced me to plan components from the inside out. Breakpoint-aware behaviors and tailored layouts became part of our system’s foundation, not an afterthought.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Unifying legacy code is political and technical:</strong>
                Replacing legacy MUI components required cross-functional buy-in, especially from engineers and leadership. I learned to frame technical debt in terms of design value, user friction, and long-term maintainability — not just aesthetic differences.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Stakeholder alignment is a design skill:</strong>
                Getting people on board wasn’t instant. I had to tell the story of the system in terms of speed, flexibility, and cohesion across products. Showcasing design + code prototypes helped make the value tangible and helped engineering prioritize integration.
            </li>

        <h3>What I’d Improve if I Did It Again</h3>
        <p>While I’m proud of the system we delivered, there are things I would do differently next time — both tactically and strategically:</p>
    
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Start stakeholder buy-in earlier, with tighter alignment on outcomes:</strong>
                It took time to get traction from engineering leadership and upper management. I spent weeks crafting detailed Notion documents, diagrams, and future-state proposals to make the case. If I were to do it again, I’d bring those stakeholders into the conversation earlier — not just to present a vision, but to co-create it with them.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Plan for contribution guidelines sooner:</strong>
                As the system grew, the need for clearer contribution workflows became obvious. Engineers and designers needed more structured documentation around how to propose, test, and implement new components or patterns. I would prioritize this earlier next time to improve adoption and reduce ambiguity.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Scale testing and accessibility coverage faster:</strong>
                While we followed basic accessibility practices, we could have formalized and automated those standards sooner. In a system that would support dozens of white-labeled apps and products, ensuring WCAG compliance and consistent user experience should be part of the foundation, not the refinement phase.

                <strong>Involve end-users in the design system process:</strong>
                We spoke often with internal teams, but less so with real end-users (especially members using the Online Portal). In the future, I’d integrate system-level usability testing earlier to ensure decisions around spacing, hierarchy, and color contrast reflect actual user behavior across devices.

        <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
        <p>Looking back, building the CUI Design System was a defining project in my career — one that sat at the intersection of design, engineering, product strategy, and systems thinking.</p>
    
        <p>It wasn't just about making things look consistent. It was about enabling scalability: giving designers faster starting points, helping engineers ship faster with fewer regressions, and making sure our white-labeled experience felt native to each Credit Union's identity — across both the Staff and Online portals.</p>
    
        <p>It also pushed me to step into a leadership role: driving alignment across cross-functional teams, identifying legacy issues that were causing real UX and dev friction, and shaping the future of our platform's design language through code, documentation, and real-time collaboration in Figma.</p>
    
        <p>More than anything, this project reaffirmed something I deeply believe: that systems work is only successful when it's inclusive — of edge cases, of teams, of use contexts, and of long-term goals. And that the best design systems don’t just unify pixels — they unify people.</p>
