        <h2 class="summary-title">TL;DR:</h2>
       
        <h5>What</h5>
        <p>I led the creation of a scalable design system to unify the Staff and Online Portals, addressing broken MUI components and white-labeling challenges for 120+ credit unions.</p>
      
        <h5>Why</h5>
        <p>The fragmented system caused inefficiencies, poor UX, and lacked flexibility for varied credit union branding needs.</p>
      
        <h5>How</h5>
        <p>Collaborating with engineers, I conducted a UI audit, created design tokens, and built scalable React components. I convinced stakeholders with prototypes and metrics showing improved development speed and consistency. Comprehensive documentation ensured seamless adoption across teams.</p>
      
        <h5>Result</h5>
        <p>The system reduced feature delivery time by 30%, visual bugs by 40%, and achieved full team adoption. Moving forward, I'd focus on better contribution guidelines, expanded accessibility testing, and earlier end-user involvement.</p>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>We were building multiple fintech tools — from public loan portals to in-branch staff apps — but had no shared design system. Components were inconsistent, styles broke, and UX varied across products. </p>
        <p>Parts of the app used outdated Material UI (MUI), which made theming rigid and slowed down devs. Engineers wanted to ditch MUI for a system they could fully control and maintain. </p>
        <p>To complicate things, our products were white-labeled for 120+ credit unions, each requiring custom branding — sometimes embedded inside their mobile banking apps. </p>
        <p>I led the full design system effort: from strategy and cross-team alignment to design, theming, and component delivery. This included: </p>

        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>We were scaling fast, but our design tooling wasn’t keeping up. Here’s what we were facing:</p>
        <div class="project-highlights">
        <ul>
            <li><h4>Broken MUI-based components</h4><p>Across all products. </p></li>

            <li><h4>White-label requirements</h4> 120+ credit unions, each needing to match their brand</li>
            <li><h4>Duplicate efforts</h4> Different teams re-creating the same components with minor variations</li>

        <h3>Strategy & Rollout</h3>
        <p>I knew a design system wouldn’t succeed unless it addressed both <span class="highlight">designer and developer</span> needs — and unless it was built with flexibility in mind. Here's how I approached it:</p>
        <div class="project-highlights">
            <ul>
              <li>
                <h4>Audit & Inventory</h4>
                <p> Conducted a UI audit to identify key issues and worked with developers to assess replacing MUI.</p>
              </li>
          
              <li>
                <h4>Foundation First</h4>
                <p>Created a scalable token system for colors, typography, and spacing, and built Figma themes for real-time white-label previews.</p>
              </li>
          
              <li>
                <h4>Defining Design Principles</h4>
                <p>Led workshops with cross-functional teams to establish core principles: simplicity, consistency, accessibility, and scalability.</p>
              </li>
          
              <li>
                <h4>Component Library</h4>
                <p>Designed 40+ components with states, variants, and usage guidelines. Coded React components and maintained the Storybook library.</p>
              </li>
          
              <li>
                <h4>Support for Two Products</h4>
                <p>Built flexible layout templates for Staff and Online Portals, with a live theming toggle in Figma for Credit Union branding.</p>
              </li>
          
              <li>
                <h4>Documentation & Onboarding</h4>
                <p>Developed Figma documentation, detailed Notion guides, and created Loom videos to onboard designers and engineers.</p>

        <p>Each component was defined with clear variants and attributes (e.g., active, disabled, primary, secondary), offering flexibility while maintaining design consistency.

        <h3>Convincing Stakeholders</h3>
        
        <p>Buy-in wasn’t immediate. MUI was “working,” and teams were focused on shipping features. But with the Staff Portal starting from scratch, I proposed using it to build our new system right — no MUI, clean components in Storybook. Quick prototypes, side-by-side mockups, and rough dev-time savings helped seal the deal.</p>
        <div class="project-highlights">
        <ul>
            <li><h4>Prototyping pain</h4>  I rebuilt a few of our most painful UI components and showed how the new system made them cleaner, more maintainable, and scalable.</li>
            <li><h4>Visual comparison</h4>I created side-by-side mockups of the broken MUI components vs. the new unified design system.</li>
            <li><h4>Metrics</h4> Talked to devs and estimated how much time we’d save in dev cycles if we invested in the new system</li>
        </ul>
        </div>

        <p>With a working example in the Staff Portal and real dev progress in Storybook, the benefits became hard to ignore. Eventually, we got the green light — and the engineering team began deprecating MUI in the Online Portal and replacing it with our new system, component by component.</p>

    <section id="whitelabel" class="section">
        <h3>White-Labeling: A Major Challenge</h3>
        <p>Because the company served dozens of credit unions, each product needed to match the branding of the partner institution. In practice, that meant:</p>
        <div class="project-highlights">
        <ul>
            <li>Need to be very strict on system colors vs brand colors</li>
            <li>Components needed to <span class="highlight">adapt</span> to different brand palettes</li>
            <li>The system had to look like a seamless part of each credit union's ecosystem</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        <p>To solve this, I designed a flexible <span class="highlight">token architecture</span> and created a Figma theming system where we could toggle between brand presets. This made it easy to validate themes visually, share previews with clients, and keep consistency without duplicating files.</p>
        <div class="image-placeholder">
            <img src="img/cui/partnercolors.png">

    <section id="staffvsonline" class="section">
        <h3>Staff Portal vs. Online Portal</h3>
        <p>One of the biggest challenges was designing a system that worked across <strong>two very different products</strong>:</p>
        <div class="project-highlights">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    
                    <h4>Staff Portal:</h4> 
                    <div class="image-placeholder">
                        <img src="img/cui/staffportal.png">
                    </div>

                    Used by Credit Union employees in-branch. Desktop-only. Requires information density, more powerful tooling, and task-focused workflows. Branding is flexible but still needs to reflect each Credit Union’s identity.
                   
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Online Portal:</h4> 
                    <div class="image-placeholder">
                        <img src="img/cui/onlineportal.png">
                    </div>

                    Used by members to apply for loans or open accounts. Mobile-first. Often embedded inside the Credit Union’s mobile app, so visual integration and responsiveness are critical. Accessible, simple, and trust-building design is essential here.
                   
                    
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    
        <p>Designing for both meant I had to keep the system <span class="highlight">flexible without fragmenting</span> into two separate systems. Here’s how I tackled the challenge:</p>
    
        <div class="project-highlights">
            <ul>
                <li><h4>Created variants for responsive needs:</h4> Components like navigation, tables, and form inputs had alternate versions for mobile vs. desktop use cases.</li>
                <li><h4>Used adaptive theming:</h4> While the Staff Portal could handle broader color use, the Online Portal needed stricter adherence to the Credit Union’s branding and mobile platform guidelines. I built flexibility into the token structure to support both needs.</li>
                <li><h4>Kept user context in mind:</h4> The tone, density, and interaction feedback differed across portals — so I documented usage guidance based on audience (e.g. “Use this version for branch staff” vs. “Use this variant for mobile loan applications”).</li>
                <li><h4>Shared core components, different wrappers:</h4> Where possible, I reused base components but wrapped them in layout containers appropriate to each portal’s needs.</li>
                <li><h4>Tested in Figma with live theming:</h4> I used theming toggles to preview both Staff and Online experiences in real time, speeding up design decisions and stakeholder approvals.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    
        <div class="image-placeholder">

        <div class="quote">Example of a similar screen on Staff portal, using the same components, but with adapted contexts for the right use cases</div>
    
        <p>The end result was a <strong>unified but context-aware system</strong> — one that respected the needs of two very different audiences, while giving engineers and designers a shared set of building blocks.</p>

    <section id="tradeoff" class="section">
        <h3>Trade-Offs & Decisions</h3>
        Design systems are about smart constraints. One key trade-off was limiting how much Credit Unions could customize their branding. Many wanted full control over colors and layout, but that wasn’t scalable or accessible. I worked with the CS team to understand expectations and align on a solution: Credit Unions could define <strong>one primary brand color</strong> — everything else followed system rules. I created demos to show the risks of full customization and helped CS communicate the limits. For non-accessible brand colors (like bright red or light yellow), I built a fallback system color to ensure contrast and clarity without breaking brand identity.

        <div class="project-highlights">
        <ul>
          <li><h4>Trade-off:</h4> Limited full customization to a single primary color instead of unlimited overrides.</li>
          <li><h4>Why:</h4> Prevent visual fragmentation, maintain accessibility standards, and speed up development with predictable theming logic.</li>
          <li><h4>Result:</h4> Credit Unions got just enough visual ownership to feel represented, while we kept the system cohesive, supportable, and accessible.</li>

        <h3>What I Learned</h3>
        <p>Building this design system from scratch across two separate products taught me valuable lessons not just about design craft — but also about technical architecture, organizational alignment, and scaling UX across real-world constraints.</p>
        <div class="project-highlights">
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4>Flexibility beats uniformity:</h4>
                : Designing for multiple themes, breakpoints, and user contexts taught me to prioritize adaptability over rigid consistency.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Code informs design:</h4>
                Building in React and Storybook deepened my understanding of dev constraints, shaping how I structure and document components.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Responsive by design:</h4>
                Supporting both mobile-first and desktop-heavy products showed me the value of planning for responsiveness from the start.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Change requires strategy:</h4>
                Replacing legacy MUI components taught me to frame design decisions in terms of business and dev impact, not just visuals.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Influence is part of design:</h4>
                Convincing stakeholders reinforced that storytelling, prototypes, and metrics are key tools in driving alignment.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What I’d Improve if I Did It Again</h3>
        <p>While I’m proud of the system we delivered, there are things I would do differently next time — both tactically and strategically:</p>
    
        <div class="project-highlights">
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4>Align early, not late:</h4>
                I’d involve stakeholders from day one to co-create the vision, speeding up buy-in and increasing shared ownership.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Document contribution paths upfront: </h4>
                Clearer workflows for proposing and updating components would have improved adoption and reduced confusion.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Build in accessibility from the start:</h4>
                Automating WCAG checks and usability testing earlier would have ensured quality across white-label variations.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Include real users sooner: </h4>
                I’d integrate feedback from actual end-users earlier, especially for the mobile-heavy Online Portal, to validate design decisions in context.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

        <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
        <p>Looking back, building the CUI Design System was a defining project in my career — one that sat at the intersection of design, engineering, product strategy, and systems thinking.</p>
    
        <p>It wasn't just about making things look consistent. It was about enabling scalability: giving designers faster starting points, helping engineers ship faster with fewer regressions, and making sure our white-labeled experience felt native to each Credit Union's identity — across both the Staff and Online portals.</p>
    
        <p>It also pushed me to step into a leadership role: driving alignment across cross-functional teams, identifying legacy issues that were causing real UX and dev friction, and shaping the future of our platform's design language through code, documentation, and real-time collaboration in Figma.</p>
    
        <p>More than anything, this project reaffirmed something I deeply believe: that systems work is only successful when it's inclusive — of edge cases, of teams, of use contexts, and of long-term goals. And that the best design systems don’t just unify pixels — they unify people.</p>
