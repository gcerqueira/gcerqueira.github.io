Sabir is a self-taught product designer with 3.8 years of experience. Being a data-driven designer, he frequently collaborated and co-owned the product with PMs, Marketing managers, and data scientists across different teams.

As a designer, he believes in the iterative process, not perfection.
Which enabled him to iterate different ideas first, and then focus on making the experience pixel perfect.

As a second designer at Internshala, he started his journey as a graphic designer. A keen interest in building things helped me to progress into the product designing role which enabled me to contribute to the product and growth it has today.

He got the opportunity to grow and mentor the design team, which now are 15+ designers across two teams of product and visual design,
the ability to think out of the box solutions.

He had the opportunity to collaborate with different PMs, and he is open to processes that would help him optimizing the product.
